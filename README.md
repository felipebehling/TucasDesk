## üìù Next Steps

Here are some potential improvements for the project:

-   **Implement JWT Authentication:** The current authentication is basic. Implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) would provide a more robust and stateless authentication mechanism.
-   **Expand Test Coverage:** Add more unit and integration tests to both the frontend and backend to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
-   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
-   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
-   **Improve User Interface:** Enhance the user interface and user experience of the frontend application.
-   **Add More Features:** Implement new features, such as email notifications, ticket assignments, and more detailed reporting.
